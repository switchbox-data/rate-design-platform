## Detailed Findings by Utility

### Con Edison (PSC No. 9 — Gas)

Con Edison has the most explicit separation between heating and non-heating residential gas service:

- **SC 1**: Residential and Religious Firm Sales Service — **NON-HEATING**
- **SC 3**: Residential and Religious — Heating Firm Sales Service — **HEATING**
  - **Rate I**: 1–4 dwelling units (single-family and small multifamily)
  - **Rate II**: More than 4 dwelling units (larger multifamily)

**SF/MF Threshold**: Con Edison's SC 3 Rate I covers buildings with **1–4 dwelling units**; Rate II covers buildings with **more than 4 units**. A 5-unit building on Con Edison territory takes Rate II (the deeper declining block), while the same building on KEDNY/KEDLI territory would still be SC 1 (individually metered residential). This is a notable difference in how the two utility systems classify the same building stock.

- **SC 13**: Seasonal Off-Peak Firm Sales Service

**Eligibility**: SC 3 tariff (Leaf 236) explicitly states: "All residential uses and purposes where gas is used for **space heating**." Con Edison application materials confirm: "GS3 is for space heating a residence." Water heating alone does **not** qualify for SC 3.

**Current Delivery Rates (effective 2/1/2026, from Con Edison allrates.pdf):**

| Component         | SC 1 (Non-Heating)            | SC 3 Rate I (Heating, 1–4 units) | SC 3 Rate II (Heating, >4 units) |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| First 3 therms    | $33.23                        | $34.00                           | $51.00                           |
| Next 87 therms    | $1.8732/therm (flat beyond 3) | $1.6383/therm                    | $1.5274/therm                    |
| Next 90 therms    | —                             | $1.3831/therm                    | —                                |
| Next 2,910 therms | —                             | —                                | $1.2721/therm                    |
| Over 3,000 therms | —                             | —                                | $1.0855/therm                    |

**Bill Impact**: Con Edison is the NY utility where the heating/non-heating distinction matters most on the bill. SC 1 has a higher flat marginal rate ($1.87/therm) than SC 3's declining block structure, but non-heating customers use so little gas that total bills stay low. SC 3's declining block design is calibrated for high-volume heating loads. The Gas Cost Factor, MFC, and RDM adjustments also differ between SC 1 and SC 3. These are genuinely different rate designs, not just administrative tracking codes.

### KEDNY — National Grid NY / Brooklyn Union (PSC No. 12 — Gas)

- **SC 1A / 1AR**: Residential Non-Heating Service (single-family)
- **SC 1B / 1BR**: Residential Heating Service (single-family)
- **SC 2-1**: Non-Residential Non-Heating Service
- **SC 2-2**: Non-Residential Heating Service
- **SC 3**: Multi-Family Non-Heating/Heating Service — **combined rate for all MF regardless of end use**
  - Internal sub-codes 3A (non-heating) and 3B (heating) share identical published delivery rates
  - Distinction affects WNA eligibility and supply cost proration only
- **SC 22**: TC (Temperature-Controlled) Multifamily/Commercial/Industrial/Government

**SF/MF Threshold**: National Grid's KEDNY Gas Load Letter (gas-request-form-nyc.pdf) defines the building type categories as "Res. 1 to 5 family" and "Multi-family 6+." Buildings with **1–5 dwelling units** are classified under SC 1 (individually metered, with heating/non-heating rate differentiation); buildings with **6 or more units** are classified under SC 3 (building-level metering, single combined rate). This differs from Con Edison, where the SC 3 threshold is at 5+ units (Rate I covers 1–4 units, Rate II covers >4 units).

**Key Feature**: MF buildings under SC 3 pay the same delivery rate whether the gas is used for heating or only cooking/water heating. The CCA filing describes SC 3 as "Heating and/or Water Heating Service (Multi-Family Buildings)."

---

### KEDLI — National Grid LI / KeySpan Gas East (PSC No. 1 — Gas)

Mirrors KEDNY structure:

- **SC 1A / 1AR**: Residential Non-Heating (single-family)
- **SC 1B / 1BR**: Residential Heating (single-family)
- **SC 2A / 2B**: Non-Residential Non-Heating / Heating
- **SC 3**: Multiple-Dwelling Service — **combined**
  - Rate Acuity confirms sub-codes 3A (Non-Heating) and 3B (Heating) exist
  - However, the published delivery rate schedule shows a **single set of rates** for all of SC 3: $37.00 first 3 therms, $0.3133/therm excess (effective April 2025)
  - The 3A/3B distinction affects WNA eligibility, supply cost allocation, and internal revenue forecasting, but **not** the actual delivery charges on the bill

**SF/MF Threshold**: The KEDLI Gas Load Letter (gas-service-request-li.pdf) uses the same categories as KEDNY: "Res. 1 to 5 family" and "Multifamily 6+." Buildings with **1–5 dwelling units** take service under SC 1; buildings with **6 or more units** are classified under SC 3. Rate case testimony (TEP-1B, Case 16-G-____) confirms KEDLI had only ~1,604 SC 3 customers vs. ~497,000 SC 1 customers at year-end 2014, consistent with SC 3 capturing only larger buildings.

**Current Delivery Rates (effective April 2025 / December 2025):**

| Service Class          | First 3 therms | Next 47 therms | Excess of 50 therms |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| SC 1A (SF Non-Heating) | $25.85         | $2.9324/therm  | $0.8928/therm       |
| SC 1B (SF Heating)     | $25.50         | $2.0482/therm  | $0.4823/therm       |

| Service Class             | First 3 therms | Excess of 3 therms |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| SC 3 (MF — all sub-codes) | $37.00         | $0.3133/therm      |

**Bill Impact**: For single-family customers, the heating/non-heating distinction produces materially different delivery rates — SF heating (SC 1B) pays significantly lower per-therm rates than SF non-heating (SC 1A) at all usage tiers. For multifamily (SC 3), the sub-codes produce no delivery rate difference.

### National Grid Niagara Mohawk (PSC No. 219 — Gas)

- **SC-1**: Residential Service — **single service classification**
- **SC-2**: Small General Service
- **SC-3**: Large General Service

Niagara Mohawk tracks heating vs. non-heating customers within SC-1 via sub-codes (bills read "Gas SC1 Residential Heat" or equivalent), but this distinction:

- **Triggers Weather Normalization Adjustment** (WNA) for heating customers (Oct–May)
- **Affects supply cost proration** (heating uses degree-day weighting; non-heating uses billing-day weighting)
- Does **not** create separate delivery rate schedules

**Current Delivery Rates (from PSC No. 219, as of April 2015 rate summary; base rates updated via surcharges):**

| Volume                 | Rate           |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| First 3 therms or less | $20.35         |
| Next 47 therms         | $0.38520/therm |
| Over 50 therms         | $0.06385/therm |

These rates apply identically to all SC-1 customers regardless of heating status. The DSA surcharges ($-0.004564/therm total for SC-1 as of 1/1/2026), SBC ($0.01452/therm), and MFC ($0.02650/therm for SC-1 residential) are also the same across SC-1.

**Bill Impact**: No material bill difference from the heating/non-heating sub-code at the same usage level. In a normal-weather year, the WNA nets to roughly zero.

**Source**: PSC tariff; National Grid rate case interrogatories (Case 20-E-0380/20-G-0381); National Grid Upstate NY service rates page; NiMo rate summary (cm5716); DSA Statement No. 29 (1/1/2026); MFC Statement No. 201 (12/1/2025).

### NYSEG — New York State Electric & Gas (PSC No. 87 — Gas)

- **SC 1**: Residential Sales Service — **single class with differential minimum charge**
  - Heating minimum charge: $20.30 (first 3 therms or less)
  - Non-heating minimum charge: $16.30 (first 3 therms or less)
  - **All usage rates above 3 therms are identical** regardless of heating status

**Eligibility scope**: "Individual private dwellings; two-family dwellings where customer is resident; flats, apartments, and separately metered non-space or non-water heating equipment in common areas used by tenants of individually metered multi-family residences of 10 units or less."

**Source**: NYSEG Gas Rate Summary effective May 1, 2025.

### RG&E — Rochester Gas and Electric (PSC No. 16 — Gas)

- **SC 1**: General Service — **single class, no heating/non-heating distinction**
- **SC 5**: Small Transportation Service (ESCO delivery)
- **SC 3**: Large Transportation Service (35,000+ therms/year)

RG&E has no rate differential between heating and non-heating residential customers. WNA exists for "space-heating customers" but the delivery rate schedule is identical.

**Source**: RG&E Gas Rate Summary effective May 2024.

### National Fuel Gas Distribution (Western NY)

- **SC-1**: Residential Sales & Transportation Service — **single class, no distinction**
- **SC-3**: General Sales & Transportation Service (non-residential)

No separate heating vs. non-heating rates for residential customers.

**Source**: National Fuel NY Rate Summary (March 2022).

### Central Hudson Gas & Electric (PSC No. 12 — Gas)

- **SC 1**: Firm Residential Customers — **single SC with sub-codes**
  - G01NH: Residence Rate Non-Heating
  - G01HT: Residence Rate **Space Heating**
  - Also EPOP variants (G01NH/G01HT) for Energy Affordability Program
- **SC 12**: Residence — Transportation (also with non-heating G12NH and heating G12HT sub-codes)

Central Hudson explicitly labels the heating sub-code as "Space Heating," confirming that water heating alone does not qualify.

**Bill Impact**: The G01NH and G01HT sub-codes share the **same delivery rate schedule** within SC 1. There is no separate rate table for heating vs. non-heating residential customers. The distinction determines WNA applicability and Energy Affordability Program (EAP) discount tier amounts (heating customers receive substantially larger monthly credits than non-heating customers), but the base delivery rates per therm are identical for the same usage level.

### Orange & Rockland Utilities (PSC No. 4 — Gas)

- **SC 1**: Residential — **with heating/non-heating sub-classifications**

O&R's rate case filings (Case 18-E-0067/18-G-0068) reference "residential gas heating" and "residential gas non-heating" as distinct customer categories within SC 1, with county-level customer counts tracked separately. O&R's Energy Affordability Program also differentiates discounts by "heating or non-heating" usage.

O&R is a Con Edison subsidiary, and its structure follows a similar pattern of tracking heating status within the residential classification.

**Bill Impact**: Like Niagara Mohawk and Central Hudson, O&R's heating/non-heating sub-classifications within SC 1 do **not** produce different delivery rates per therm. The distinction drives WNA applicability, Revenue Decoupling Mechanism (RDM) allocation, and low-income/EAP discount amounts. The actual delivery rate schedule is a single SC 1 structure with identical rates for all residential customers.

**Source**: O&R rate case interrogatories (DPS filing, Case 18-E-0067/18-G-0068); O&R Energy Affordability Program documentation; O&R three-year rate plan (effective April 1, 2025).

## Analytical Patterns

### Pattern 1: Downstate Complexity, Upstate Simplicity

The downstate utilities (Con Edison, KEDNY, KEDLI) have the most elaborate heating/non-heating rate structures with separate service classifications carrying different delivery rates. Upstate utilities (National Fuel, RG&E) tend toward single residential classifications with no rate distinction at all. Mid-state utilities (Niagara Mohawk, NYSEG, Central Hudson) occupy a middle ground with sub-codes or minor charge differentials within a single SC.

### Pattern 2: Multifamily Treatment

Only two utility systems explicitly break out MF buildings:

- **Con Edison**: Rate I (1–4 units) vs. Rate II (>4 units) within heating SC 3. The SF/MF boundary is at **5 units** — a 5-unit building takes Rate II.
- **KEDNY/KEDLI**: Dedicated SC 3 for all MF buildings (combined heating/non-heating). The SF/MF boundary is at **6 units** — buildings with 1–5 dwelling units take SC 1, and 6+ units take SC 3. This means a 5-unit building in Brooklyn (KEDNY) is individually metered under SC 1 with separate heating/non-heating rates, while the same building in Manhattan (Con Edison) is a multifamily account under SC 3.

All other utilities fold small MF into their standard residential SC without special treatment.

### Pattern 3: Eligibility = Space Heating

Where eligibility criteria are specified in tariff language, the determinant is consistently **space heating**, not water heating alone:

- **Con Edison**: Tariff explicitly requires "gas is used for space heating"
- **Central Hudson**: Rate code labeled "Residence Rate Space Heating"
- **NYSEG**: Tariff references "non-space or non-water heating equipment" as a separate category
- **Niagara Mohawk**: WNA applies to "heating customers" under SCs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7

No NY gas utility was found to classify a customer as "heating" based solely on gas water heating.

### Pattern 4: Where the Heating/Non-Heating Distinction Actually Affects the Bill

The heating/non-heating classification produces **materially different delivery rates** only at:

| Utility               | Rate Impact?          | Mechanism                                                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Con Edison**        | **Yes — large**       | Entirely separate SCs with different rate designs (flat vs. declining block) |
| **KEDNY/KEDLI (SF)**  | **Yes — significant** | SC 1A vs. 1B have different per-therm rates at all usage tiers               |
| **KEDLI (MF)**        | No                    | SC 3A/3B sub-codes share identical delivery rates                            |
| **NYSEG**             | Minimal               | $4.00/month minimum charge difference; usage rates identical                 |
| **Niagara Mohawk**    | No                    | Single rate schedule; sub-code affects WNA only                              |
| **Central Hudson**    | No                    | Single rate schedule; sub-code affects WNA and EAP discounts only            |
| **Orange & Rockland** | No                    | Single rate schedule; sub-code affects WNA and RDM allocation only           |
| **RG&E**              | No                    | No distinction at all                                                        |
| **National Fuel**     | No                    | No distinction at all                                                        |

For utilities where delivery rates are identical, the heating/non-heating designation still matters for: (1) Weather Normalization Adjustment applicability, (2) supply cost allocation methodology, (3) Energy Affordability Program / low-income discount tier amounts (heating customers typically receive much larger monthly credits), and (4) internal revenue forecasting and rate case allocation.

_Research compiled February 2026. Updated with delivery rate comparisons, bill impact analysis, and SF/MF threshold definitions. Based on publicly available tariff filings, rate summaries, rate case interrogatories, utility application forms, and utility documentation. The KEDNY/KEDLI SF/MF threshold (1–5 family vs. 6+ multi-family) is drawn from National Grid's operational Gas Load Letter forms, not from the PSC-filed tariff leaf applicability language, which was not publicly accessible. Smaller utilities (Corning Natural Gas, Liberty/St. Lawrence Gas, Chautauqua Utilities, Bath Electric Gas & Water, Fillmore Gas) were not researched in detail._
