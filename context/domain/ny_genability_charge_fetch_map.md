# NY Genability Charge Fetch Map

Exhaustive charge-level reference for fetching 2025 monthly rate values from the Arcadia/Genability API. Each row is one `tariffRateId` in the platform's NY default residential electric tariff JSONs. Used as input for top-up implementation (BAT revenue requirement).

**Utility abbreviations:** CE = ConEd, LI = PSEG-LI, RG = RG&E, NY = NYSEG, NG = National Grid, OR = O&R, CH = Central Hudson.

## How to fetch rates

- **Fixed:** `rateAmount` is in the tariff JSON; no API call. Use `fixed_value` column.
- **Lookup:** Call `GET /rest/public/properties/{variableRateKey}/lookups?fromDateTime=2025-01-01T00:00:00&toDateTime=2026-01-01T00:00:00` (paginate with `pageStart`/`pageCount`). Response has effective periods; expand to monthly rows for 2025.
- **rider_placeholder:** Entry has no rate data in this tariff (chargeType null, empty rateBands). Rates may be in rider sub-tariff; use rider API with `riderId` from tariff JSON.
- **superseded:** Old placeholder replaced by another entry in the same tariff with the same logical charge; use the other entry for fetch.

## Notes

- **National Grid Delivery Charge Adjustment:** Rider header (tariffRateId 20715133) is `rider_placeholder`; the 12 zone sub-entries (6 Electricity Supply Charge + 6 Delivery Charge Adjustment per zone) are listed separately with their own decisions (supply → add_to_srr, delivery → already_in_drr).
- **Central Hudson Miscellaneous Charges:** Single Genability lookup bundles multiple sub-charges (arrears, EV, storage, VDER, DR, make-whole); we apply add_to_drr to the full amount.
- **Duplicate entries:** Where both an old rider placeholder and a newer CONSUMPTION_BASED entry exist for the same charge, the placeholder is marked superseded.
- **National Grid rider placeholders** (MFC, CBC, GreenUp, EV Make Ready, Arrears, Net Plant, RAM with null chargeType and empty rateBands): marked rider_placeholder; fetch may require rider API.
