## 1 Purpose

This document describes the electric **Marginal Cost of Service (“MCOS”) Study** prepared by PSEG Long Island on behalf of the **Long Island Power Authority (“LIPA” or “the Authority”)**, in reference to the August 19, 2024 **Order Addressing Marginal Cost of Service Studies** of the New York State Public Service Commission (“Commission”) in **Cases 19-E-0283 and 15-E-0751** (“MCOS Order”).[^1]

The purpose of a marginal cost of service study is to determine the **incremental cost** to provide an incremental megawatt (“MW”) of capacity on LIPA’s distribution system. Marginal cost includes **capital costs** and **operating costs**. The costs are presented as an **annual revenue requirement**; that is, once the initial capital cost and the ongoing operating costs are determined, the annual revenue requirement needed to provide a return on capital and operating costs can be determined.

Consistent with the MCOS Order, PSEG Long Island, on behalf of LIPA, performed a marginal cost study to develop **location-specific avoided distribution costs**. PSEG Long Island utilized its latest **8-year, fiscal year (“FY”) 2025 to 2032, capital investment plan**. PSEG Long Island’s planned capital expenditures were based on its forecasted load requirements. The load forecasts utilize PSEG Long Island’s 8-year **Electric Peak Forecast**, developed annually, with the most recent forecast issued for the 2025 budget process.

## Capital Projects

The MCOS Study base input is the **capital investment plan** for the period of time between 2025 and 2032. PSEG Long Island identified the capacity enabled by each project and the corresponding total cost including risk and contingency. This resulted in a portfolio of **30 discrete substation and line projects**. In many instances, projects need to be executed in conjunction with one another to enable any expansion of system capacity. Assets were put into **four (4) “Asset Classes”**:

- **Transmission Station (“T-Station”)**
- **Transmission Line (“T-Line”)**
- **Distribution Station (“D-Station”)**
- **Distribution Line (“D-Line”)**

The portfolio of projects included in this analysis **totals $600 million**.

## 2 Capital Cost per Capacity Added MW

For each of the assets identified, the individual projects were summarized, as provided in **Exhibit 1**, to determine the following:

- **Location**
- **Asset Class**
- **In service date**
- **Capacity Added** for the project
- **Capital spending** for those projects and the spending for those projects with risk and contingency
- **Cost per MVA**
- **Total Capital spending** over the period, broken out by asset class: T-Station, T-Line, D-Station, D-Line

This information was used to compute **capital cost per MW of Capacity Added** for each component (T-Station, T-Line, D-Station, D-Line). These values are equal to **Total Capital spending for each component, divided by Capacity Added**.

---

## 3 Marginal Cost: Revenue Requirement per Capacity Added MW

PSEG Long Island multiplied (i) **capital cost per MVA of Capacity Added by component** by (ii) the **Economic Carrying Charge Rate (“ECCR”)** for that component.

The **ECCR** is a rate that is applied to a capital cost in order to determine the annual revenue requirement needed to provide return on capital, return of capital, and operating costs.

The following inputs are used in computing the ECCR:

- **Return on capital and return of capital:**
  - Weighted average cost of capital and weighted return on equity
  - Book: Depreciation life
- **Operating costs:**
  - Revenue Taxes
  - Insurance as a percentage of Plant

The rate base applicable to the asset is determined for each year, based on original cost, depreciation, and accumulated. A return on rate base is determined using cost of capital. Annual depreciation expenses are computed. Finally, operating expenses are computed. The **annual revenue requirement** is the sum of return on and of capital and operating expenses.

The ECCRs for each component of assets included in the MCOS are shown below. The percentages are multiplied by the original capital cost to determine annual revenue requirement.

| Component    | ECCR  |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Transmission | 4.79% |
| Distribution | 5.02% |

---

## 4 Other Revenue Requirement Loaders

The cost of capital multiplied by ECCR is then loaded for other Revenue Requirement components, such as O&M, A&G and General Plant.

- **Plant Loaders:**
  - **General Plant Adder** as a percentage of Plant Additions at **2.9%**
- **Operating cost Loaders:**
  - **Operation & Maintenance (“O&M”)**, which includes working capital and administrative and general (“A&G”) expenses as percent of Plant at:
    - **3.4%** for Transmission
    - **8.9%** for Distribution

### Exhibit 1 — MCOS Results

Exhibit 1 presents the system-wide marginal cost by rate class. All rate classes share the same underlying capital costs and ECCR rates; the marginal cost is uniform across classes.

| # | Rate Class                                | Rate Code                               | TX/Sub-TX Capital ($/kW) | Primary/Secondary Dist Capital ($/kW) | TX ECCR+O&M (%) | Dist ECCR+O&M (%) | **MC of Service ($/kW)** |

**Notes:**

1. Costs are escalated into 2025 using a ten year Compound Growth Rate of the Handy-Whitman Index.
2. Economic Carrying Charge Model includes O&M, Taxes, and Insurance.

**Derivation:** MC = (TX Capital × TX Rate) + (Dist Capital × Dist Rate) = $563.17 × 8.2% + $721.12 × 13.9% = **$146.90/kW-yr**. This is the annual revenue requirement per kW of system capacity, combining transmission ($46.18/kW-yr) and distribution ($100.24/kW-yr). The combined ECCR+O&M rates (8.2% TX, 13.9% Dist) match the narrative: ECCR (4.79% TX, 5.02% Dist) + O&M (3.4% TX, 8.9% Dist) = 8.19% and 13.92%, rounded.
