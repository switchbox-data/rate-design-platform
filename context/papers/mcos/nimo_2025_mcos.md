## Purpose

This document describes the electric **Marginal Cost of Service (“MCOS”) Study** prepared by Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (“National Grid” or the “Company”), in compliance with the August 19, 2024 **Order Addressing Marginal Cost of Service Studies** of the New York State Public Service Commission (“Commission”) in Cases 19-E-0283 and 15-E-0751 (“MCOS Order”).[^1]

The purpose of a marginal cost of service study is to determine the **incremental cost to provide an incremental megawatt (“MW”) of capacity** on the Company’s distribution system. Marginal cost includes capital costs and operating costs. The costs are presented as an **annual revenue requirement**; that is, once the initial capital cost and the ongoing operating costs are determined, the annual revenue requirement needed to provide a return on capital and operating costs can be determined.

The MCOS Order requires that the Company determine marginal costs for each applicable substation serving area with planned capacity expansion, for each year over the next 10 years. National Grid utilized its latest 10-year, fiscal year (“FY”) 2026 to 2036,[^2] capital investment plan. The Company’s planned capital expenditures were based on its forecasted load requirements. Transmission load forecasts are developed using New York Independent System Operator (“NYISO”) forecasts, while distribution load forecasts utilize the Company’s 10-year Electric Peak Forecast, developed annually, with the most recent forecast issued March 21, 2025. The latest peak forecast report can be found on the [National Grid New York System Data Portal](https://systemdataportal.nationalgrid.com/NY/).[^3]

The MCOS Order further states that the MCOS Study should use the same information as would be presented in a utility’s major rate case filing; that is, the MCOS should reflect the Company’s actual expected capital costs, operating costs, and forecasted load.

## Capital Projects

To begin the MCOS Study, National Grid leveraged its latest developed capital investment plan for the period of time between FY 2026 and FY 2036. The Company excluded projects with a total cost of less than $1M, as generally those projects do not support material system capacity expansion. Where possible, the Company identified the capacity enabled by each project or group of projects, the corresponding total cost, and the impacted system facilities (e.g., substations). This resulted in a portfolio of **440 discrete, mostly substation and line, projects**. In many instances, projects need to be executed in conjunction with one another to enable any expansion of system capacity. This resulted in system capacity expansion at **153 assets** (i.e., substations, transmission network). For each project or group of projects, the following was identified:

- **Substation area**
- **Purpose of the project** (i.e., spending rationale): **Multi-Value Transmission (“MVT”)**, **Multi-Value Distribution (“MVD”)** or **System Capacity**. Multi-Value projects are performed both to increase capacity and to maintain or improve system reliability, whereas System Capacity projects are undertaken to increase capacity on the distribution system.
- **Capacity Added** for the substation measured in MWs.
  - _Capacity Added_ means the demand that can be served in the substation area when all of the projects in that substation area are completed, compared to the demand that could be served if none of the work is undertaken and completed.
  - All projects that affect a substation are grouped to form the total Capacity Added MW quantity for that substation.
- **Asset types affected**: **Transmission Station (“T-Station”)**, **Transmission Line (“T-Line”)**, **Distribution Station (“D-Station”)** and **Distribution Line (“D-Line”)**.
  - Transmission level assets operate at or above 69 kilovolts (“kV”).
- **Annual capital spending and total forecasted spend**, shown by asset type (T-Station, T-Line, D-Station, D-Line).

The portfolio of projects included in this analysis totals **$10.7 billion** and was grouped by substation, transmission network, or sub-transmission network.

## Capital Cost per Capacity Added MW

For each of the 153 assets identified, the individual projects were summarized, as provided in **Exhibit 1**, to determine the following:

- **Capacity Added** for the substation area (Exhibit 1, Column B).
- **Annual capital spending**, by fiscal year, for 2026 through 2036 (Exhibit 1, Columns C26X through C36). The C26X column is the total spend of included projects prior to FY2026.
- **Total Capital spending** over the period, broken out by component: T-Station, T-Line, D-Station, D-Line (Exhibit 1, Columns C-TS, C-TL, C-DS, C-DL and C).

This information was used to compute **capital cost per MW of Capacity Added** for each component (T-Station, T-Line, D-Station, D-Line), and in total (Exhibit 1, Columns D-TS, D-TL, D-DS, D-DL and D). These values are equal to Total Capital spending for each component, divided by Capacity Added.

While capital spending takes place over the years the project is under construction, the **Capacity Added** to the distribution system is not available until the project is completed and in service. Therefore, the last year of capital spending for all projects in the substation area was determined to be the year that capacity was added (i.e., **in-service year**) (Exhibit 1, Column F).

## Marginal Cost: Revenue Requirement per Capacity Added MW

For each substation, the Company multiplied (i) capital cost per MW of Capacity Added by component by (ii) **Economic Carrying Charge Rate (“ECCR”)** for that component, to determine (iii) the **annual revenue requirement** needed to provide return on capital, return of capital, and operating costs. The annual revenue requirement for each component is shown in Exhibit 1, Columns E-TS, E-TL, E-DS, E-DL; the total annual revenue requirement is shown in Exhibit 1, Column E. This annual revenue requirement is the **marginal cost to provide one additional MW of capacity**.

The marginal cost determined above represents the marginal cost for the **year that the project’s added capacity went into service**. To determine the marginal cost over the 10-year period, the annual marginal cost was deflated annually for years prior to the in-service year or inflated annually for years after the in-service year by the **inflation rate** (Exhibit 1, Columns F26 through F36). The inflation rate reflects the current expectations about inflation from the most up-to-date **Blue Chip consensus forecast** of the Gross Domestic Price implicit price deflator, as recommended by the Staff Whitepaper in the VDER Proceeding,[^4] and further supported by the Commission in the MCOS Order. As such, National Grid used a **2.1% inflation rate** per the June 2, 2025 Blue Chip Financial Forecasts.

The Company also computed a **system-wide average marginal cost per MW by year**, with the results shown on Page 28 of Exhibit 1, line 250. This was computed as follows:

1. For each fiscal year, the capacity of all projects that go into service that year was determined (Page 28 of Exhibit 1, line 247).
2. The discount factor from that year back to FY 2026 was determined, using the annual inflation rate of 2.1% (Page 28 of Exhibit 1, line 248).
3. Total marginal cost of capacity added in the year was determined by multiplying capacity added (line 247) by average marginal cost for the year (line 245), with the results on line 249.
4. Each annual amount was discounted back to FY 2026, by dividing total marginal cost of capacity in the year (line 249) by the applicable discount factor (line 248), with the results on line 250.
5. The annual amounts on line 250 were summed and the sum was divided by total capacity added of **11,533 MW**, to arrive at the **system-wide average annual marginal cost per MW of $71,524** (Page 28 of Exhibit 1, line 251). This is equal to the FY 2026 Annual Marginal Cost per MW (line 245, column F26).
6. This calculation includes only substations with capital projects over the period FY 2026–FY 2036 that are included in the MCOS Study.

## Economic Carrying Charge Rate (ECCR)

The **ECCR** is a rate that is applied to a capital cost in order to determine the annual revenue requirement needed to provide return on capital, return of capital, and operating costs.

The following inputs are used in computing the ECCR (using data from the National Grid electric rate case currently pending before the Commission):[^5]

- **Return on capital and return of capital:**
  - Weighted average cost of capital and weighted return on equity
  - Federal and State income tax rates
  - Federal: Depreciation life, depreciation method, Year 1 depreciation, Double Declining Balance (“DDB”) Rate
  - State: Depreciation life, depreciation method, Year 1 depreciation, DDB Rate
  - Book: Depreciation life, salvage value
- **Operating costs:**
  - Operation & Maintenance (“O&M”) as percent of Plant
  - Property Tax as percent of Plant
  - Insurance as percent of Plant

The rate base applicable to the asset is determined for each year, based on original cost, depreciation, and accumulated deferred income tax (the difference between taxes paid and taxes included in rates). A return on rate base is determined, reflecting the after-tax cost of capital and a gross-up for income taxes. Next, annual depreciation expense is computed. Finally, operating expenses are computed. The **annual revenue requirement** is the sum of return on capital, return of capital, and operating expenses.

The **ECCRs for each component** of assets included in the MCOS are shown below. The percentages are multiplied by the original capital cost to determine annual revenue requirement.

| Asset component | ECCR   |
| --------------- | ------ |
| T-Station       | 8.21%  |
| T-Line          | 8.44%  |
| D-Station       | 8.06%  |
| D-Line          | 14.13% |

The calculation of the ECCRs and supporting detail are provided in **Exhibit 2**.
