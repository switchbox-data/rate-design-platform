## 1 Introduction

Avangrid retained Charles River Associates ("CRA") to conduct a marginal cost of service (MCOS) study for the New York State Electric and Gas Corporation ("NYSEG") and Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation ("RG&E"; together with NYSEG, "the Companies"). In August 2024, the Commission issued an Order ("the August Order") requesting that the Companies file MCOS study updates to be filed along with the Companies' Distributed System Implementation Plans ("DSIP").[^1] The MCOS studies were intended to support and advance the objectives of New York's Reforming the Energy Vision ("REV") proceeding. Currently, the MCOS study results inform the Value of Distributed Energy Resources ("VDER") within the Value Stack proceeding (commonly referred to as "the MCOS proceeding").[^2]

CRA has developed an MCOS study for each of the Companies, consistent with the Commission's overall methodological guidelines, per the August Order. The MCOS studies produce a long-term view of system-wide marginal cost estimates associated with the cost of meeting peak load growth on the local transmission and distribution system over the next 10-year planning period (2026-2035).

This report provides more details on the approach that the studies adopted to estimate marginal costs for each service component and presents a summary of the results for each Company.

The report is organized as follows:

- **Section 2** describes the context of the study and drivers of investment.
- **Section 3** summarizes the Companies' grid configuration and study approach, and any assumptions that were made in developing the study if needed to supplement available information.
- **Section 4** reviews findings of results and implications for each area of the Companies' distribution service, as well as the importance of considering areas of the system that may not need to expand its facilities.
- **Section 5** reviews time-differentiation of the resulting marginal costs for consideration in future evaluations of marginal cost-based compensation of injections to the grid.
- **Section 6** reviews the marginal cost of local facilities by customer classification.

## 2 Context and Objectives of the Study

### A. Benefits of Marginal Information for Pricing

MCOS studies offer valuable information on the expected ongoing cost of providing delivery service to accommodate expected changes in demand due to organic growth, economic development, and DERs, at different times of day and at different voltage levels. The Companies' service territories are experiencing increasing customer adoption of renewable distributed generation ("DG"), electric vehicles ("EVs"), and energy storage, coupled with expectations of significant growth in building electrification through air source heat pumps. The combination of these changes, along with energy efficiency ("EE") programs, has a significant impact on the patterns of the hourly load profile and peak demands that the transmission and distribution grid must accommodate system-wide and at any given location. In this context, the Commission directed the utilities to update their MCOS studies and ensure that they are consistent with a long-term view of system-wide capacity conditions.

The MCOS study results, when used to establish price signals for electricity imports from the grid or compensation for injections of power, may have beneficial outcomes. Specifically, they are helpful to: (a) incentivize customers to use the grid efficiently, i.e., only when the customer values electricity more than the marginal cost of providing the service; and (b) contribute to an efficient pace of DER adoption, since the distribution value that DER can effectively provide to the system is monetized and reflects how changes in demand affect the way the Companies plan and operates their systems. To more effectively meet those goals, price signals provided to users of the grid would ideally be temporal (differentiated by time of day) and locational. The MCOS studies summarized in this docket are built on the information provided by the Companies regarding planned capacity expansion investments at the substation and feeder level. The MCOS study calculates marginal costs per kilovolt-ampere ("kVA") of capacity gained from the investment at each location and aggregated by planning division and system-wide by year and by cost segment, as requested by the August Order.

### B. Expected Trend of Growth-Related Investment Needs

The Companies anticipate a continuous decline in summer peak load in the near term and a significant acceleration in long term winter peak load growth as transportation and building electrification become more prevalent, consistent with NYISO projections for the state as well as the Companies' internal forecasting.[^3] Currently, summer peak load drives most of the grid's growth-related capacity investment, due to the lower carrying capability of the system in the hotter months. However, both Companies expect the grid to experience declining summer peak loads in the upcoming years. For example, NYSEG summer distribution peak loads are expected to be about 7.6 percent lower in 2035 compared to 2024. By contrast, NYSEG distribution winter peak loads are expected to grow significantly every year, resulting in a total growth of 22 percent by 2035. RG&E's winter peak loads are expected to increase even more, by about 43 percent through 2035. As a result, winter peak loads will increasingly be responsible for capacity-related investments on the part of both Companies in the second half of the study period.

The number of units with N-0 summer season capacity violations are expected to decrease consistently throughout the 10-year study period for NYSEG. RG&E has substantially more summer-peaking substations than NYSEG. However, due to the higher winter peak load growth expected, the Company will need to begin to expand substation and feeder capacity due to both summer and winter peak loads starting in 2031. Figure 1 through Figure 4 reflect the expected incremental number of stations and feeders with capacity investment needs to avoid violating the capacity requirement standard during normal conditions (N-0 violations) in each season over the study period, i.e., before considering growth-related reliability investments.

[^3]: The Companies relied on NYISO's "Gold Book" peak load projections for each respective Company's load zone, adjusting as needed with the Company's own expectation of areas likely to experience higher electrification.

## 3 Approach to Estimate Upstream and Primary Marginal Costs

### A. Grid Configuration

The starting point for an MCOS study is identifying the relevant segments of a given company's local transmission and distribution grid system. In the Companies' MCOS studies, investments were categorized into four cost components, i.e., high-voltage upstream lines, upstream substations, distribution substations, and primary circuits. The voltage levels for each segment are as follows:

1. **Upstream distribution** (also known as "transmission"):[^4]
   - Substations that are fed from the 115kV system and convert power to either 69kV or 46kV or 34.5kV
   - Feeders at 115 kV, 46 kV or 34.5kV that feed distribution substations

2. **Lower-voltage primary distribution grid:**
   - Distribution substations that convert power directly from 115 kV or the 34.5 kV systems to 12.47 kV or 4.6 kV.
   - Trunk-line primary distribution feeders, that start at the substation until the line branches to create a primary tap. These circuits typically operate at 12.47 kV or 4.6 kV; both Companies are in the process of converting 4.6 kV to 12.47 kV.

3. **Local distribution facilities** that connect the customer premises to the grid, which include the local primary taps that serve localized loads[^5], secondary line transformers, and secondary lines. The cost driver of those facilities are customer connections, rather than a forecast of diversified peak demand, and they are sized to customer local long-term needs.

[^4]: The Companies refer to this segment of the grid as "transmission". The MCOS study refers to these upstream substations and lines as "upstream" distribution, to differentiate them from the more regional transmission grid costs that are recoverable through NYISO Transmission Service Charges (TSCs).

[^5]: These primary circuits typically are covered under the line extension policy and funded by the customer and is not considered a system-wide cost, rather a per-customer cost.

[DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION: Figure 5. Electricity Delivery System Configuration]

A simplified one-line diagram of the Companies' electric delivery system. At the top, bulk substations are shown at 115 kV or 345 kV, with step-down transformers. The next level shows 34.5 kV and 12 kV or 4 kV feeders; step transformers connect to 12 kV or 4 kV primary distribution. At the bottom, step transformers connect to 4 kV and then to "M" (metered customer(s)). The flow is: 115kV or 345kV → Step Xfmr → 34.5kV → 12kV or 4 kV (feeders) → Step Xfmr → 12kV or 4kV (primary) → Step Xfmr → 4kV (secondary) → Metered Customer(s). This illustrates the hierarchy: upstream (transmission-level) substations and feeders, distribution substations, primary circuits, and local secondary facilities to the customer.

### B. Overall Approach Framework

The MCOS studies evaluate both the near-term and longer-term (10-year) incremental cost impact of peak load additions on the grid. The analysis requires gathering the required load and cost data inputs, examining the local transmission, distribution, and feeder investments that qualify for inclusion in the study, checking alignment with underlying growth forecast assumptions, and other detailed analysis, including the extent to which the reliability projects take place as a result of the specific growth in the substation area or adjacent areas, as well as the capacity added.

All relevant year-by-year, capacity-related investments are first identified at the substation and feeder (or "circuit") level and then divided by the specific project load carrying capability added at that location. These costs are then aggregated and averaged by division by weighting each project by their relative capacity added, to estimate a division's average marginal unit cost. The weighted average calculation is conducted so that the projects that add more capacity relative to others are recognized as more representative for purposes of average division marginal unit cost. These projects are more likely to accommodate higher peak load growth and tend to be longer-term capacity solutions.

The basic steps in calculating the MCOS estimates can be summarized as follows:

1. Identify appropriate investments in the capital plan, the pattern of annual expenditures at each location, as well as the expected capacity gained at each substation or feeder project.
2. Estimate year-by-year marginal investments per kW of added carrying capability at each location.
3. Annualize marginal investments and add operating and maintenance ("O&M") expenses and administrative and general ("A&G") loading factors at each substation area and division level. Annualized costs are first calculated on each substation and feeder to provide information on locational values and the relative higher value areas within each Company's service territory.
4. Evaluate peak load growth by 2035 that may cause additional units to be expanded to include potential projects not in the current capital plan.
5. Estimate year-by-year, capacity-weighted marginal investments for each planning division within the service territory by each of the four cost segments.
6. Ultimately, system-wide levelized marginal costs over the 10-year period are estimated for purposes of averaging system-wide costs; all individual projects for a given year are averaged, using a capacity-weighted average approach for each year. To be truly system-wide average, areas with no expected investment are assigned zero weight in the calculation.

### C. Selection of Investment from Companies' Capital Plan

For both NYSEG and RG&E, a sizeable amount of reliability and growth-related investments is needed over the upcoming planning period to reliably meet load growth in their respective service territories. These include investments related to meeting reliability standards designed by utility system planning engineers to handle forecasts of increased demand at the substation and feeder level. The Companies' MCOS studies are in alignment with the Commission requirements. The Commission's August Order stated the studies need to include multi-value investments, as long as they have a growth component. As a result, the MCOS study includes all planned investments needed to meet incremental peak load growth from existing and/or new customers, with the condition that they provide capacity expansion, and including multi-value capital expenditures to the extent that the area is experiencing growth-related needs.

The Companies decide on the expansion of transmission and distribution-level substations and feeders based on the capacity needed at those facilities to reliably meet the forecasted substation area and feeder load over the planning period. CRA worked with the Companies to develop a detailed understanding of each specific transmission and distribution investment in the capital plan, with the goal of identifying capacity solutions that would allow CRA to produce reasonable marginal costs reflective of the next ten-year period.

The forecasted peak load growth is a combination of organic growth, anticipated electrification, and/or economic activity. These projects fall in the category of Distribution Load Relief, Reliability, Prospective Planning, and "Comprehensive Area Studies". Capacity-expansion investments may address capacity deficiencies expected during base loading conditions (N-0), and/or design standard violations related to the loss of one transformer or feeder contingencies (N-1).[^6] In some cases, the transformer and feeder are expected to be able to serve forecasted demand under baseload conditions (N-0), but capacity expansion may still be needed if the area lacks adequate N-1 redundancy and cannot be fully backed-up through neighboring circuit field tie switching.[^7] The Commission considers both types of investments as suitable for inclusion in an MCOS study provided they are driven by increased peak loads, to some extent.

In general, if a significant change in forecasted peak load on the particular location is not expected to affect a specific planned investment, the project is considered to have little bearing on the marginal cost per kW of load carrying capability and could distort the true cost of meeting incremental peak load or the benefit to the system of peak load shaving if included in the study. Investments that expand capacity largely as a result of replacing equipment that has reached the end of its useful life are an example where investment is needed regardless of the level of peak loading, and therefore are not included in the study. The Companies' MCOS studies also exclude investments exclusively related to asset condition and modernization, if the Company would have undertaken such investments regardless of peak loading at the substation or feeder.

In consultation with the Companies, CRA reviewed service areas within the transmission and distribution system and the locations at the upstream level (115kV, 34 kV) and the distribution system level (12.5 kV and 4.6 kV) that are expected to face thermal and low voltage limits due to forecasted growth. Each Company selects the most cost-effective capacity solutions to address those constraints and ensure electrification and economic development can be met reliably. The type of solutions may involve a transformer replacement with larger capacity, increased circuit ties, and/or conductor voltage conversion. In some areas, the Companies employ lower cost near-term solutions such as substation or feeder load transfers, to provide temporary capacity headroom prior to a longer-term solution.

[^6]: For example, in the case of substations with more than one transformer, the Companies' standards require that the station peak load does not exceed the short-term emergency (STE) rating of the smaller transformer in the substation.

[^7]: Any N-1 investments included in the study are consistent with the Companies' reliability planning standards and not the result of a step change in the standard amount of redundancy needed per unit of forecasted peak load growth.

The MCOS studies identify the year when a station and/or feeder-related project is scheduled to take place in each location, along with the expected in-service date and capacity added.[^8] All projects in the MCOS studies have in-service dates no later than by 2035. The approach recognizes that a given investment is typically phased in to reflect the Company's construction schedule.

The MCOS studies prepared for the Companies' 2025 rate case included dollars of investment through 2031. To address the longer timeframe required by the August Order, CRA reviewed additional investments that the Companies plan to undertake and extend beyond the initially formalized capital plan. These include projects under Comprehensive Area Studies (CAS) which include a set of transmission and distribution capacity solutions for high-growth areas within the service territory and are expected to come into service mainly between 2032 and 2035. Including the longer-term CAS and local transmission reinforcement projects, a total of 55 planned upstream projects and 57 distribution projects from the Companies' capital plans were included in NYSEG's MCOS study, and a total of 31 upstream projects and 61 distribution projects were included in RG&E's MCOS study.

[^8]: CRA assumed the level of capacity added for projects based on proxy investments of the same type when feeder related projects lacked this information.

### D. Selection of Additional Potential Investments

To identify potential additional investment needs for the last three years of the 10-year period (2033-2035), CRA conducted an independent analysis to identify the share of additional substations and/or feeders potentially requiring growth-related capacity expansion through year 2035, by comparing forecasted load at each substation and feeder in the Companies' service territories to 95 percent of their respective capacity normal ratings ("CNR").[^9] CRA applied the forecasted 2026-2035 annual growth rates to the 2024 station and feeder peak loads, under the assumption that the projections of summer and winter annual system-wide growth rates are representative of the individual substations and feeders' annual peak load percent change.

The peak load shares corresponding to the identified substation and feeder areas in potential need of capacity expansion were then considered in the calculation of system-weighted average marginal costs. The focus of this exercise was on estimating substations and/or feeders potentially requiring capacity expansion for N-0 reasons and not additional investments needed to mitigate N-1 violations, beyond those already identified in the transmission reinforcement programs of the Companies. This approach was conservative to reflect the fact that the Companies do not usually target all N-1 contingency violation at any given planning period to avoid excessive pressure on rates.

[^9]: The comparison considered the highest of the forecasted winter and summer peak loads for each year through the ten-year period. If the peak load in any season of any year for a given unit exceeded 95% of that unit's CNR, it was considered to potentially require growth-related capacity expansion.

### E. Identification of Incremental Capacity Expansion Over 10-Year Period

Next, the study identified the capacity added by each project in each location. In areas where the addition of a transformer is driven by N-1 needs, the calculation uses the total project added capacity to determine the marginal unit cost, and not only the capacity used under N-0 conditions. Typically, when peak loading on the substation or feeder begins to exceed 90 percent capacity, a mitigation strategy is employed to avoid voltage instability. The selected annual substation and feeder investments over the 2026-2035 period were divided by kW of added peak load carrying capability by multiplying added capacity by 0.9 to reflect the Companies' criteria.

All initial estimates of marginal investment were calculated on a substation/feeder basis for each year of the study period, separately for upstream (transmission) and distribution, within each division. These marginal costs are potentially avoided from peak load reductions anywhere in the system, as these facilities are planned for the collective demand of all customers downstream of the facilities.

The MCOS studies also capture the earlier years of construction of an asset. A customer adding 1 kW of incremental peak load downstream of the particular facility in the year when the asset first begins construction is considered to contribute to the upcoming identified investment need and therefore the corresponding marginal investment per kVA of added carrying capability is calculated for each year of construction, using total project added carrying capability that is discounted to the respective year of construction.

### F. Annualizing investment

The marginal investments per kW of load-carrying capability were annualized and converted to marginal costs by applying the appropriate economic carrying charges ("ECC"). The annualized ECC formula includes the salvage value of the plant. The ECC, when applied to a capital investment, produces the first-year annual revenue requirement of a series of annual capital charges that remain constant in real terms over the life of the asset.[^10] The discount rate is the Companies' current, after-tax, weighted average cost of capital which represents the rate of return the Companies can earn over the service life of a plant addition. The final step of the computation of annualized costs requires estimating marginal O&M expenses per kW and applying loading factors to account for general plant growth and A&G expenses, including an allowance for working capital. Distribution O&M expenses are a component of marginal cost, since they grow with the amount of plant in service.

[^10]: Revenue requirement includes the depreciation expense, minus net salvage cost, income taxes, and property insurance.

### G. Calculating a System-Wide Weighted Average Cost

As a last step, CRA computed a system-wide weighted marginal unit cost that accounts for the share of the system not expected to require expansion of transformer or feeder capacity to meet future peak load growth. This last step is helpful to inform a geographically uniform rate applicable to 1 kW of peak load growth or 1 kW anywhere in the service territory. Estimating this average marginal cost also ensures that any payments that are based on a uniform system-wide price to compensate for power injections into the grid are aligned overall with total capacity-related savings to the Companies through the 10-year period. However, for informational purposes, the MCOS studies also calculate unweighted marginal unit costs, corresponding to an average of marginal costs in areas of the service territory in need of expansion.

## 4 Summary of Results

The MCOS studies computed substation and feeder marginal unit cost on a dollar per kilowatt-year ($/kW-yr) basis at each substation and feeder in the capital plan. These values are averaged by division and system wide. Annual marginal cost values for each component of the grid are stated in nominal dollars for each year, as well as levelized as a constant value for years 2026 to 2035. In accordance with the August Order, the marginal costs are shown at the local upstream (local transmission), distribution substation, and distribution feeder level, representing estimates of marginal costs per kW of incremental peak load served for each facility type. The marginal cost estimates of high-voltage feeder and high-voltage substations were computed separately but then combined into the Upstream category for purposes of presentation of results.

The marginal upstream, distribution and feeder cost per kW is shown in two ways. The first approach shows year-to-year values and assumes that once the asset is in service, the forward-looking marginal cost per 1 kW of peak load growth (or benefit from 1 incremental kW of peak load reduction) is zero. This marginal unit cost shown this way is illustrative of a scenario where the distribution price can be updated every year to reflect the year's marginal cost value. This section shows these results summarized system-wide and by division, while year-to-year annualized costs by the individual substation are provided in Appendices B and C. The second approach states annual marginal costs on a cumulative basis through the 10-year period, reflecting the ongoing cumulative cost associated with 1 kW of incremental peak load growth that materializes each year, or the cumulative value of 1 kW of consistent peak load reduction in each year through the entire period. These values, averaged system-wide and by division, are shown in Appendix A. Appendix D shows the ten-year levelized marginal cost detail by substation. These values are helpful to set rates that reflect a ten-year average marginal cost but are not updated annually except for inflation.

### A. NYSEG Results

**Table 1** reflects the capacity-weighted levelized marginal unit cost by division. These values are 'unadjusted' for any existing excess capacity, i.e., if there are substation or feeder locations within a given division with no anticipated capacity expansion investments over the 10-year study period, the averaging by division ignores these areas. Therefore, these values are only representative of locations within a division where incremental peak load will trigger investment. If applied uniformly as a price per kW for any peak load reduction anywhere within the division, it would overcompensate, or over-value, peak reduction/injections to the grid. However, values are shown for informational purposes. All marginal cost estimates reflect fully loaded annualized marginal costs, adjusted for loading factors and O&M. The total marginal cost across cost components is adjusted by losses for primary and secondary voltage.

**Table 2** reflects the year-by-year system-wide annualized marginal costs by cost segment, after averaging across all divisions. Each division's average marginal cost has been weighted according to the division's peak load share, i.e., its share of total system non-coincident peak load.[^11] These marginal cost estimates still do not account for the fact that not all substations and feeders in a given division require capacity upgrades, therefore they are not fully representative of annual average growth-related investment needs anywhere in the system.

[^11]: The division with relatively larger forecasted peak load has a higher probability of representing a larger share of peak load and capacity additions relative to other areas system-wide.

A line chart with years 2026–2035 on the horizontal axis and nominal $/kW-yr on the vertical axis (from $0 to about $120). Three series: Upstream, Dist. Substation, and Primary Feeder. Upstream and distribution substation costs rise in the later years; primary feeder shows a peak in the middle years.

The next step was estimating system-wide average marginal cost estimates to reflect a truly system-wide, weighted marginal cost. Locations with sufficient capacity to meet forecasted peak load over the next 10 years are weighted as zero. The annualized investment is weighted by the share of the peak load located in areas subject to expansion. About 77 percent of the upstream system and about 65 percent of the distribution substations and primary feeders in NYSEG's service area are expected to have sufficient capacity to reliably accommodate load over the next 10 years, based on the 2035 forecasted peak loads. Each year's marginal cost is therefore a function of the cost per kW of added capability and the share of the system requiring investment in the particular cost segment and year.

**Table 3** reflects the resulting system-wide weighted annualized marginal costs by cost segment. Figure 7 illustrates these same annual marginal costs across years. The bulk of the upstream investment is concentrated in the later years of the 10-year period.

[DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION: Figure 7. NYSEG System-Weighted Marginal Unit Cost, Adjusted for Areas with No Capacity Expansion Investment]

Line chart with years 2026–2035, nominal $/kW-yr (roughly $0–$55). Three series: Upstream, Dist. Substation, Primary Feeder. Shows the system-weighted (excess-capacity-adjusted) annual marginal costs; values are lower than in Figure 6 because areas with no investment are weighted zero.

For comparison purposes with the system-wide average values shown in Table 3, a summary of purely unweighted annualized marginal costs is provided in **Table 4** below. These cost levels reflect the average annual marginal cost per kW of added carrying capability for each cost segment after averaging annualized costs, weighted by each project's added capacity, across all capacity solutions included in the study. The averaging only includes marginal cost in divisions experiencing capacity expansion needs, therefore they are helpful to assess the average annualized investment per-kW level per year averaged system-wide for capacity-constrained substation areas, but it is not applicable to all areas with system-wide load growth. Upstream investment is shown separately for upstream substation and upstream feeders.

### B. RG&E Results

The same marginal cost analysis was used for RG&E's service area. **Table 5** reflects the system-wide average marginal unit cost, with values representative of locations that need to expand capacity to reliably meet growth. The annualized capacity-weighted marginal costs over the 10-year study period are adjusted by losses for primary and secondary voltage. **Table 6** shows the levelized marginal cost for each RG&E division, by component and total.

**Table 7** shows the annual system-wide marginal cost, adjusted to recognize that not all areas in a given division require investment to reliably meet peak load in a particular year. The system-wide marginal cost calculation effectively applies zero marginal cost to the share of substations and feeders in the system not expected to need expansion through 2035 (about 54 percent of distribution substations, and 66 percent of primary feeders).

## 5 Time-Differentiation of System-Wide Marginal Costs

For use in any pricing application, the annualized upstream distribution substation and feeder marginal cost will need to be allocated to the hours of the year that are the most likely to drive investment needs as peak load grows. CRA conducted analysis by day-type and month, based on each hour's relative probability of being the annual peak, using the distribution system hourly loads during the three most recent years (2022 - 2024), and a forecast of hourly loads for years 2025 through 2028 by simulating hourly impacts on the system load profile from the expected near-term added electrification and behind the meter solar generation by typical day.

NYSEG summer peak loads are currently much closer to winter peak loads compared to RG&E. Additional behind-the-meter ("BTM") generation will reduce the number of hours in the summer that are likely to trigger capacity needs, given a reduction in mid-day loads. The evening distribution peak loads will increasingly trigger grid capacity expansion relative to mid-day hours in both summer and winter. Figure 10 and Figure 11 illustrate a typical summer and winter weekday, respectively, in NYSEG as of 2028.

[DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION: Figure 10. Expected Near-Term Load Profile for a Typical Summer Weekday, NYSEG]

A line chart with hour of day (1–24) on the horizontal axis and Load (MW) on the vertical axis (0 to about 3000). Three series: Baseline, Heat Pump, BTM Solar. Shows how heat pumps and behind-the-meter solar change the summer weekday shape (e.g., midday solar reducing load, evening peak from cooling/heat pumps).

Similar to Figure 10 but for a typical winter weekday: hour of day vs Load (MW), with Baseline, Heat Pump, and BTM Solar. Winter morning and evening peaks reflect heating and lighting load.

The probability of peak analysis ("PoP") revealed that currently, the combined months of June and July through September account for approximately 91 percent and 99 percent of the annual probability of peak, for NYSEG and RG&E, respectively. For NYSEG, the remaining non-zero probabilities fall mainly in the months of December through February and for RG&E, in May. Beginning approximately in 2028, about 29 percent of the NYSEG's cumulative summer probability of peak is expected to shift to the three coldest winter months of Dec–February beginning by 2028.

The PoP produces allocation factors for each hour, by day-type (weekdays, weekends, and holidays) and month. This assessment incorporates temperature impact on grid carrying capability. These factors are useful in evaluating the time differentiation of near-term marginal costs. Updates to the analysis will be required every few years to estimate changes in appropriate time-differentiation. **Figure 12** illustrates the year-round hourly probability of peak for a weekday and a weekend day in NYSEG's service area to reflect the likely profile of marginal costs across hours. The peak hours will be expected to concentrate between 5 pm and 9 pm in the summer months, as well as winter. Winter morning hours will have a moderate contribution to investment needs, but to a much lower extent relative to the evening hours.

## 6 Local Distribution Facilities Costs

Local distribution facilities in the context of MCOS studies refer to the secondary voltage lines, line transformers, and local primary taps. The Companies' engineers decide on the type of the required facilities using design standards that take into consideration the number of customers who are expected to use those facilities and their maximum demands over the service life of those facilities. These facilities are less extensively shared compared to the upstream distribution substations and primary feeders. The cost per customer may change depending on whether the system is radial or networked, i.e., whether there is potential for sharing the transformer extensively, and whether they are single or polyphase service.

To estimate the local facilities costs, the MCOS analysis relies on the MCOS analysis undertaken by CRA as part of the Companies' 2025 rate cases. It involved the review of a representative sample of work orders associated with customer connection jobs for single-phase and three-phase customers in the last four years (2021-2024), for the Companies' residential, commercial and industrial customers. To estimate the typical installed cost of distribution facilities, CRA computed the average per kW, using the typical assigned transformer capacity per customer class and net of customer contributions, as per the line extension policy. Separate costs of facilities were estimated for underground vs. overhead, single-phase or three-phase, and ultimately a weighted average cost was calculated for each customer class, based on the customer mix within the class. Table 9 and Table 10 summarize the annual marginal local distribution facilities costs, in 2025 dollars.
