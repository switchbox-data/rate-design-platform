## I. Introduction

On August 19, 2024, the New York State Public Service Commission (“Commission”) issued an order[^1] in Case 15-E-0751 and Case 19-E-0283 that addressed marginal cost of service studies. The Commission directed Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (“the Company”) to file a Marginal Cost of Service (“MCOS”) study on or before June 30, 2025 and include this study in the Company’s Distribution System Implementation Plan filing due on or before June 30, 2025.

The following sections describe the Company’s proposals to meet the directives of the MCOS Order.

[^1]: Order Addressing Marginal Cost of Service Studies (the “MCOS Order”).

## II. MCOS Study

The MCOS Order establishes an MCOS methodology based on the traditional National Economic Research Associates’ (“NERA”) methodology as modified in the MCOS Order. The MCOS Order directs utilities to use a ten-year planning horizon when producing their MCOS study estimates. To ensure that the studies are reasonably long-run in nature, all load growth and multi-value projects (i.e., simultaneously growth and reliability related) planned under the 10-year horizon are to be included in the study. The MCOS studies are required to present the costs of each segment of T&D networks, including FERC-regulated bulk transmission system costs, down to costs at the local distribution primary and secondary line level. The utilities are required to present costs at a level of granularity that includes the substation serving area level. Marginal costs shall be presented for each year of the 10-year study period. Study results shall be listed separately for all 10 years.

The MCOS study submitted in this filing adheres to the methodology described above. It calculates marginal costs for each substation serving area over a 10-year period of 2025 through 2034 for the following five cost centers:

1. Transmission System Cost Center
2. Area Substation and Sub-transmission Cost Center
3. Primary Feeder Cost Center
4. Distribution Transformer Cost Center
5. Secondary Cable Cost Center

Investment needs, their timing, and location for the first two cost centers are taken from the Company’s area substation and transmission station ten-year capital plan. Investment needs, their timing, and location for the other cost centers (namely the Primary Feeder, Distribution Transformer, and Secondary Cable cost centers listed above) are typically studied and identified only a year to a year and a half in advance and are not readily available for the entire ten-year study period. The study relies on historical samples of load growth and multi-value projects that went into service during 2025 to assess the investment costs for these lower voltage cost centers on a substation serving area basis.

For each cost segment, investment costs are developed on a per kW of added capacity for each load growth and multi-value project. Investment costs are then annualized and converted into revenue requirement figures using a composite factor, which incorporates various loading factors including adders associated with general/common plant, property insurance, operation and maintenance expenses, working capital, and the economic carrying charge. As directed by the MCOS Order, Blue Chip Consensus Forecast of the GDP Implicit Price Deflator is used to develop escalation factors. Resulting marginal cost estimates are presented at both substation serving area level and at the region (borough) level. Region level costs are used to determine system average marginal costs per kW of system peak. When developing region level and system average marginal costs, the study excludes estimates of zero marginal costs for serving areas that do not have planned capital projects within the study’s 10-year time horizon. In addition, as per the NERA methodology, once projects included in the MCOS study reach their in-service dates, they continue to be included in the calculation of MCOS values for the duration of the study’s 10-year horizon.

The following schedules (showing revenue requirement dollars) are presented in the Company’s MCOS study:

- **Schedule 1** – System-Weighted Transmission & Distribution Marginal Costs per kW of System Peak
- **Schedule 2** – Segment Level Regional Marginal Costs
- **Schedule 3** – Total Marginal Cost by Area Substation
- **Schedule 4** – Transmission Marginal Costs by Area Substation
- **Schedule 5** – Area Station and Sub-Transmission Marginal Costs by Area Substation
- **Schedule 6** – Primary Feeder Marginal Costs by Area Substation
- **Schedule 7** – Transformer Marginal Costs by Area Substation
- **Schedule 8** – Secondary Cable Marginal Costs by Area Substation
- **Schedule 9** – Independent Load by Area Substation
- **Schedule 10** – Coincident Factor
- **Schedule 11** – Composite and Escalation Factors

## III. Load Forecast Methodology

This section addresses the MCOS Order directive on including a discussion of the Company’s load forecasting methodology.

### Forecast of System Peak Demand Growth

Every year, following the summer peak season, the Company produces a series of forecasts to guide the next planning cycle, including 20-year electric system peak demand forecasts and a 5-year system energy forecast. The single electric system peak hour (system-wide and by network load area) developed as part of the peak demand forecast sets the design point for maintaining system reliability.

These forecasts are developed using a hybrid of top-down and bottom-up methodologies, which improves forecasting accuracy by allowing for cross-referencing of meter data and queued projects with overall macro-economic trends. Additionally, by comparing the top-down system-wide peak load analysis to the bottom-up network peak load analyses, the Company can verify the allocations of load in its annual peak load forecast.

The electric peak demand forecast is produced by adding incremental MW demand growth of key customer sectors: residential, commercial, and governmental. Along with sector demand growth, non-sector-specific technology-driven load growth is also added, such as electric vehicles (“EV”), building electrification (“BE”), or conversions from steam to electric air conditioning (“A/C”).

There are various DER measures that offset demand, such as EE, DR, DG/CHP, PV, BESS, and targeted load relief programs, collectively referred to as negative load modifiers. DER are forecasted using primarily bottom-up methodologies by counting projects or program totals for both system and network forecasts. EE and DR forecasts are based on program-level projections based on historical and expected future performance. PV, DG/CHP, and BESS are forecasted using cumulative historical penetration, known queued projects, and extrapolated future growth rates.

The positive load modifiers, EVs, steam to electric A/C and BE, are also forecasted using a bottom-up methodology. EV forecasting is based on current registration data from the Department of Motor Vehicles, expected growth rates based on State goals and outside studies, and the assumed average kW per vehicle. Steam to A/C conversions are driven by steam chillers replacement with electric chillers. Incremental load growth from steam to electric A/C is based on the aggregation of all customer conversions. BE forecast converts fossil fuel equipment in buildings to electric usage within the Company’s service territory over a 20-year horizon. This forecast includes the Electrification of Heating in winter and Electrification of Non-space Heating, which covers equipment such as water heaters, dryers, and stoves throughout the year.

### Network Load Area Independent Peak Demand Forecast

Con Edison also prepares distribution load area (network and radial) level peak demand forecasts, which roll up to the substation level. Networks are forecasted both for their independent peaks (termed “Independent Network Peak Forecast”), which may differ from the system peak hour and can vary among networks, and for their coincidence with the system peak (termed “Coincident Network Peak Forecast”). Similar to the system demand forecast, the loads are modified to account for any applicable reductions for DER-related programs and other load growth (EE, PV, BESS, DG/CHP, BE, EVs and steam A/C to electric A/C). The Network Forecasts are developed in parallel with the System Forecast during the early fall to incorporate the most recent summer experience. However, the Coincident Network Peak Forecast requires some parameters determined in the System Forecast, so it cannot be finalized until after the System Forecast is complete.

### DER Load Modifier Forecast

Increased adoption of DER will introduce new challenges for maintaining forecasting accuracy due to uncertainties associated with the variability of DER output, its evolving correlation with net load, and the impact of geographic diversity on aggregate DER output. These new DER will have locational-specific impacts determined in part by the ways in which penetration rates evolve in each part of the distribution system. As a result, increasing levels of DER will drive the need for forecasting of future net load levels at more granular levels. For example, pairing top-down econometric forecasting approaches with more granular forecasts will enable planners to evaluate distribution system needs more accurately as DER penetration increases. These more granular load forecasts consider economic indicators and analyze load shapes based on the characteristics of individual loads or local areas. The development of these approaches for forecasting both load and DER output will enable more accurate representation of the system at varying load levels to help planners understand when and where constraints may emerge.

The Company’s concurrent DSIP filing presents additional details of the load forecasting methodology.

## IV. Reserve Margin

This section addresses the MCOS Order directive on including a discussion of how reserve margin is reflected in the MCOS studies.

When planning the electric system at the Area Substation and Sub-transmission level, two components are used to calculate reserve margins – net load projections, and feeder & substation capability. Net load projections are obtained from Commodity Forecast’s Network and Radial Supply Area Independent Forecast, over a 10- and 20-year period. Sub-transmission feeder and Area Substation capability is determined by the installed capacity and evaluated under design contingency scenarios, loss of one or two supply(s) to stations: transformers or their supply feeders, ensuring reliability. The result for capability determination is N-1 or N-2, where N is the number of Area Substation transformers installed, and -1 or -2 is the number of transformers/sub-transmission feeders assumed out of service.

The reserve margin is the difference between the installed system capability minus projected net load. This reserve margin serves as an input for calculating the Marginal Cost of Service (MCOS) at an Area Substation level.

## V. Conclusion

As described herein, the Company’s updated MCOS study meets the requirements of the Commission’s MCOS Order. The Company looks forward to working with Staff and other stakeholders to discuss this study.
