## I. Introduction

On August 19, 2024, the New York State Public Service Commission ("Commission") issued an order[^1] in Case 15-E-0751 and Case 19-E-0283 that addressed marginal cost of service studies. The Commission directed Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. ("the Company") to file a Marginal Cost of Service ("MCOS") study on or before June 30, 2025 and include this study in the Company's Distribution System Implementation Plan filing due on or before June 30, 2025. The following sections describe the Company's proposals to meet the directives of the MCOS Order.

[^1]: Order Addressing Marginal Cost of Service Studies (the "MCOS Order").

## II. MCOS Study

The MCOS Order establishes an MCOS methodology based on the traditional National Economic Research Associates' ("NERA") methodology as modified in the MCOS Order. The MCOS Order directs utilities to use a **ten-year planning horizon** when producing their MCOS study estimates. To ensure that the studies are reasonably long-run in nature, all load growth and multi-value projects (i.e., simultaneously growth and reliability related) planned under the 10-year horizon are to be included in the study. The MCOS studies are required to present the costs of each segment of T&D networks, including FERC-regulated bulk transmission system costs, down to costs at the local distribution primary and secondary line level. The utilities are required to present costs at a level of granularity that includes the **substation serving area level**. Marginal costs shall be presented for each year of the 10-year study period. Study results shall be listed separately for all 10 years.

The MCOS study submitted in this filing adheres to the methodology described above. It calculates marginal costs for each substation serving area over a 10-year period of **2025 through 2034** for the following four cost centers:

1. Transmission System Cost Center
2. Area Substation and Sub-transmission Cost Center
3. Primary Feeder Cost Center
4. Secondary Distribution Cost Center

Investment needs, their timing, and location for the first two cost centers are taken from the Company's area substation and transmission station ten-year capital plan. In addition, the Company develops a five-year capital budget for the Primary Feeder cost center. Investment needs, their timing, and location for the Secondary Distribution cost center, consisting of distribution transformer and secondary cable costs, are typically studied and identified only a year to a year and a half in advance and are not readily available for the entire ten-year study period. The study relies on **historical samples** of load growth and multi-value projects that went into service during 2025 to assess the investment costs for this cost center on a substation serving area basis.

For each cost segment, investment costs are developed on a **per kW of added capacity** for each load growth and multi-value project. Investment costs are then annualized and converted into revenue requirement figures using a **composite factor**, which incorporates various loading factors including adders associated with general/common plant, property insurance, operation and maintenance expenses, working capital, and the economic carrying charge. As directed by the MCOS Order, **Blue Chip Consensus Forecast of the GDP Implicit Price Deflator** is used to develop escalation factors. Resulting marginal cost estimates are presented at both **substation serving area level** and at the **region level**. Region level costs are used to determine system average marginal costs per kW of system peak. When developing region level and system average marginal costs, the study **excludes estimates of zero marginal costs** for serving areas that do not have planned capital projects within the study's 10-year time horizon. In addition, as per the NERA methodology, once projects included in the MCOS study reach their in-service dates, they continue to be included in the calculation of MCOS values for the duration of the study's 10-year horizon.

The following schedules (showing revenue requirement dollars) are presented in the Company's MCOS study:

- **Schedule 1** – System-Weighted Transmission & Distribution Marginal Costs per kW of System Peak
- **Schedule 2** – Segment Level Regional Marginal Costs
- **Schedule 3** – Total Marginal Cost by Area Substation
- **Schedule 4** – Transmission Marginal Costs by Area Substation
- **Schedule 5** – Area Station and Sub-Transmission Marginal Costs by Area Substation
- **Schedule 6** – Primary Feeder Marginal Costs by Area Substation
- **Schedule 7** – Secondary Distribution Marginal Costs by Area Substation
- **Schedule 8** – Independent Load by Area Substation
- **Schedule 9** – Coincident Factor
- **Schedule 10** – Composite and Escalation Factors

## III. Load Forecast Methodology

This section addresses the MCOS Order directive on including a discussion of the Company's load forecasting methodology.

### Overview of Forecasting Methodology

Each year, as part of its ten-year forecasting process, the Company forecasts overall system load and the projected summer peak loads for each transmission facility, individual substation including each transformer bank, and each distribution circuit. This process begins immediately after each summer as substation and circuit data is collected, analyzed, and cleaned (from the impact of switching, outages, or weather-related impacts). Once all outliers are removed, the Company uses **mathematical regression models** to analyze all summer weekday/non-holiday substation transformer load data along with the corresponding daily **Temperature Variable (TV)** to determine weather-normalized peak loads for each transformer bank. The TV is used in calculating and forecasting future system peak demands, taking into account extreme summer weather conditions, sustained high temperatures and humidity over a three-day period, that we would expect to experience in the O&R area in one of every three years.

The Company considers the impact of **load modifiers**, which include:

- **Climate Change**
- **Distributed Energy Resource (DER)**: Photo Voltaic (PV), Electric Vehicle (EV), Combined Heat and Power (CHP), Building Electrification of non-heating (EoNH), and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) including Non-wire Alternative (NWA)
- **Demand Side Management (DSM)**: Energy Efficiency (EE) and Demand Response (DR) programs

The Company then uses the forecasted loads to perform operating reviews on each of its major assets. These reviews cover transmission lines and substation transformer banks down through their respective distribution circuits, for both normal and contingency operating conditions.

Forecasting is an integral part of O&R's planning process and is one of the most important and influential components of the integrated planning effort, and which drives overall planning results. To further improve its planning process, the Company has focused on incorporating greater granularity in its forecasting models to better understand how specific load modifiers (i.e., the quantity, the location, and the temporal characteristics) impact the system. This enhanced forecasting process is another tool the Company uses to send correct signals to the market, the DER developer community, and other third parties to deploy solutions in the most appropriate locations of the O&R service territory to support the safe and reliable operation of the electric grid.

### Summary of each modifier

The Company will continue to refine its forecasting methodology and will be better positioned to adjust its plans/forecasts as required. Below are a few examples of how the Company is using information on specific load modifiers to inform forecasts.

- **Climate Change**: The Company introduced a line item to its forecasting process to account for climate change's anticipated impact on peak demand. This modifier is informed by the Company's CCVS which utilizes climate projections as provided by NYSERDA in partnership with Columbia University.
- **CHP**: The Company utilizes an internal model combining both a "bottom-up" queue-based and/or "top-down" growth approach. For a short term (usually years 1–2), the Company prefers to use a bottom-up approach using jobs in queue or historical growth. If there is no pending job in the queue, the long term growth is applied based on the historical installation.
- **EV**: The EV forecast is developed in the newly designed REV/DER forecasting model and includes the peak impact of charging for both light-duty and medium/heavy-duty EVs. This forecast is informed by Department of Motor Vehicle registration data, comprehensive industry research, and customer project information.
- **PV**: The PV forecast is developed in the newly designed REV/DER forecasting model. The Company has deployed an improved queue management system at the circuit level to capture the status of current and pending PV projects. The Company analyzed average solar output curves during the summer months and applied the results to the forecasts every year, as provided by metered interval data. The forecasts now reflect two different types of average solar output curves, (1) residential/small commercial and (2) large-scale/community solar, using both system and bank peaking hours to develop granular level forecasts.
- **BESS**: The BESS forecast is developed in the newly designed REV/DER forecasting model. As the number of solar-plus-storage projects grows every year, the Company has continued to include granular level forecasts considering different coincident factors to differentiate small and large solar-paired batteries, as well as standalone residential and commercial battery storage. The Company treats NWAs as part of the BESS modifier to both represent their effects on local facilities in the forecasting and planning process, and, for reporting purposes, to provide granular level forecasts.
- **EoNH**: The REV/DER forecasting tool is utilized for the O&R service territory, which enabled more sophisticated modeling of BE adoption with a more diverse array of inputs. The inputs themselves have also been enhanced, including AMI usage data to guide forecasted load shapes and net efficiency of conversion from gas to electric equipment, as well as assumptions towards BE adoption that are more tailored toward the regions within the service territory.
- **DSM**: The DSM programs consist of EE and DR programs. The EE programs are expected to reduce the peak forecasts over a five-to-six-year horizon. These include both those administered by the New York State Energy and Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), New Jersey Office of Clean Energy (NJOCE), and those administered internally by O&R and RECO. O&R has three Demand Response Programs for peak shaving and contingency: the Commercial System Relief Program (CSRP), the Distribution Load Relief Program (DLRP), and the Direct Load Control Program (DLCP). These programs pay commercial and residential customers to provide temporary load reduction during the summer to avoid or delay transmission and distribution system investment and improve the reliability and resiliency of electricity delivery systems.

This advanced understanding of the impact of load modifiers, combined with the ability to develop bottom-up forecasts from granular level data, will enhance O&R's ability to plan for and address the requirements of the CLCPA. Increased understanding of how different load modifiers impact the grid will support O&R's ability to produce more granular, long-term forecasts. Such forecasts will provide Company engineers and planners with greater insights to determine how load modifiers can be incorporated to determine appropriate system needs to meet design standards, address the clean energy goals of the CLCPA, and enhance the safety and reliable operation of the electric delivery system.

The Company's concurrent DSIP filing presents additional details of the load forecasting methodology.

## IV. Reserve Margin

This section addresses the MCOS Order directive on including a discussion of how reserve margin is reflected in the MCOS studies.

For MCOS studies, the Company uses **spare capacity** and **reserve margin** to evaluate the cost and value of providing additional capacity to meet future demand. These concepts help determine how much it costs to serve incremental load and where infrastructure investments are most needed. **Spare capacity** represents the unused portion of existing infrastructure (transmission, or distribution) that can serve additional load without requiring new investment. As part of the annual planning process, the Company will continue to identify areas where load can grow without triggering new costs.

The **reserve margin** ensures system reliability by maintaining extra capacity above peak demand. In MCOS, it affects how much capacity must be added to serve new load reliably. As part of the capital planning process, the Company evaluates if adding new load would reduce the reserve margin below acceptable levels. This helps to assign costs to customers or locations that drive the need for additional capacity to maintain reserve margins.

To incorporate spare and reserve margin the Company integrates this in the forecasting process through the new business load growth and other modifiers by predicting where and when new demand will occur. As part of the contingency analysis process, the Company determines if existing infrastructure can handle the new load and evaluate whether the new load would reduce reserve margins below thresholds. These results help inform DER incentives, and capital planning.

## V. Conclusion

As described herein, the Company's updated MCOS study meets the requirements of the Commission's MCOS Order. The Company looks forward to working with Staff and other stakeholders to discuss this study.
