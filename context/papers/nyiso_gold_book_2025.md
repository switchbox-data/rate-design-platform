| Note: 99th percentile summer peak demand forecast is representative of an extremely hot and humid (well above expected weather) summer peak day. Note: Expected weather conditions include an increasing temperature trend from the NYISO Climate Change Impact Study Phase I report. Note: Forecast values assume no demand response reductions. Note: Ratios based on Load Forecast Uncertainty distributions reviewed by Load Forecasting Task Force (LFTF) and New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC) Installed Capacity Subcommittee (ICS) in spring 2023 & retained in spring 2024. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                              |

| 1. This table includes the potential status changes of units to comply with DEC Peaker Rule and laws and policies related to the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Units listed have not proivded a notice to the NYSPSC or completed a Generator Deactivation Notice with the NYISO. 2. These units have indicated they will be out of service as noted in their compliance plans in response to the DEC peaker rule. 3. These units have indicated they will be out of service during the ozone season (May through September) in their compliance plans in response to the DEC peaker rule. To address the Need identified in the 2023 Q2 STAR, the NYISO designated the generators on the Gowanus 2 & 3 and Narrows 1 & 2 barges to temporarily remain in operation after the DEC Peaker Rule compliance date (May 1, 2025) until permanent solutions to the Need are in place, for an initial period of up to two years (May 1, 2027). 4. Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) has submitted notifications to the DEC per Part 227-3 of the Peaker Rule stating that these units are needed for reliability allowing these units to operate as directed by PSEG Long Island, until at least May 1, 2025 5. The 2023-2024 Enacted New York State Budget legislation amended the Power Authority Act to require the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to publish a transition plan by May 2025 to phase out electrical production from its eleven “small natural gas power plants” and to cease electricity production from those plants using natural gas by 12/31/2030 unless NYPA determines that such plant or plants are needed for emergency power service or electric system reliability, or existing or proposed replacement generation resources would result in more than a de minimis net increase of emissions of CO2 or criteria air pollutants within a disadvantaged community. NYPA will solicit public input on proposed plant deactivation decisions, which will be made on a plant-by-plant basis. Deactivation notices must be filed timely with the NYISO for each deactivation.
