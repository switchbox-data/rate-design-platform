# ISO-NE Forward Capacity Market assumptions for RI (Southeast New England zone)
# used by utils.cairo::_return_ISONE_capacity_prices to convert $/kW-month and
# capacity supply obligation MW into annual capacity costs allocated to peak hours.
#
# RI is in the Southeast New England (SENE) capacity zone.
# We use SENE clearing prices with RI-specific CSOs (not system-wide or full
# SENE zone) so the total capacity cost pool reflects what RI ratepayers
# actually pay. The peak-hour allocation still uses ISO NE CA system load
# shape (the workbook's "ISO NE CA" sheet).
#
# Note on price concept: we use the raw FCA clearing price, NOT the FCM
# effective charge rate. The effective charge rate includes adjustments for
# multi-year rate locks, winter IPR, self-supply variance, HQICC, and ARA
# reconfigurations — those adjustments do not belong in a marginal cost signal.

    notes: |
      Calendar-year 2025 spans two commitment periods:
        Jan–May 2025  → CCP 2024-2025 (FCA 15)
        Jun–Dec 2025  → CCP 2025-2026 (FCA 16)

      RI is in the Southeast New England (SENE) capacity zone.

      FCA clearing prices (from fca-results-report.pdf):
        FCA 15 SENE: $3.980/kW-month
        FCA 16 SENE: $2.639/kW-month

      RI capacity supply obligations (from 2024 CELT Report, Table 4.1):
        FCA 15: summer 2,158.971 MW / winter 2,194.808 MW
        FCA 16: summer 2,251.117 MW / winter 2,238.267 MW
      We use the winter CSO as a conservative estimate (winter is the binding
      constraint for heat-pump-heavy load profiles).

      For reference, full SENE zone (RI + SEMA):
        FCA 15: summer 7,250.090 MW / winter 7,467.855 MW
        FCA 16: summer 7,809.319 MW / winter 7,922.089 MW
