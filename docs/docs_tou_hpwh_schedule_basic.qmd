# Introduction

This document outlines a simple, first-pass heuristic-based decision model for consumer response to time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates in residential building simulations using OCHRE, focusing on Heat Pump Water Heaters (HPWHs). The goal is to integrate an adaptive control schedule for the HPWH based on feedback from utility bills and anticipated cost savings, while accounting for consumer effort in shifting schedules.

# 1. Problem Definition

- **Objective:** Model how a consumer, with fixed (exogenous) hot water usage needs, might reschedule their HPWH operation in response to TOU rates to minimize their electricity bills, considering a "switching cost" for effort/comfort.
- **Assumptions:**
    - Hot water usage schedule is fixed (not flexible).
    - HPWH can be controlled (on/off) on a schedule.
    - TOU rate structure (on-peak/off-peak) is known and simple (e.g., higher price during peak hours).
    - Consumer receives feedback on energy cost at each billing cycle (monthly).
    - Switching to a TOU-adapted schedule incurs a one-time "effort cost" (can be fixed or parameterized).
    - Decision process is repeated each billing cycle (feedback loop).

|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| \( S \)        | Current HPWH schedule (default or TOU-adapted)       | binary         |
| \( U_{HW} \)   | Exogenous hot water usage schedule                   | L/hr           |
| \( \lambda \)  | Usage multiplier (building characteristic)           | scalar         |
| \( E \)        | Electricity consumption profile (from HPWH operation)| kWh            |
| \( r_{on}, r_{off} \) | TOU electricity rate (on-peak, off-peak)     | $/kWh          |
| \( C_{bill} \) | Monthly electricity bill (for water heating)         | $              |
| \( C_{switch} \) | Consumer switching/"hassle" cost                   | $              |
| \( \Delta C \) | Anticipated bill savings from switching              | $              |

# 3. Model Steps

## Step 1: Calculate Baseline

- **Hot Water Usage:** \( U_{HW}(t) \) is fixed by schedule and multiplier.
- **HPWH Default Schedule:** Operates as needed to meet hot water draws.
- **Simulate:** Run OCHRE with default HPWH schedule to get \( E_{default}(t) \), \( C_{bill,default} \).

## Step 2: Define TOU-Adaptive Schedule

- **HPWH TOU Schedule:** Only operates HPWH during off-peak hours (unless tank runs cold).
- **Simulate:** Run OCHRE with TOU-adaptive HPWH schedule to get \( E_{TOU}(t) \), \( C_{bill,TOU} \).

## Step 3: Anticipated Savings

- **Calculate:**
    \[
    \Delta C = C_{bill,default} - C_{bill,TOU}
    \]
- **Net Benefit:**
    \[
    \text{Net Savings} = \Delta C - C_{switch}
    \]

## Step 4: Decision Rule

- **If** \( \text{Net Savings} > 0 \): Consumer switches to TOU-adapted schedule.
- **Else:** Remains on default schedule.

## Step 5: Feedback & Iteration

- At each monthly billing cycle, repeat Steps 1–4 using updated consumption and bills.
- Consumer can reconsider switching if conditions change (e.g., rate structure, switching cost).

# 4. Integration with OCHRE

## Inputs Required

- Hot water usage schedule: `HotWaterUsageSchedule`
- Usage multiplier: `UsageMultiplier`
- TOU rate definition: `r_{on}, r_{off}` (passed to cost calculation)
- HPWH scheduling control: ability to enforce on/off operation windows

## OCHRE Outputs Used

| Output Name                   | Use in Model                         |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Hot Water Delivered (L/min)   | For checking comfort/unmet demand    |
| Water Heating Delivered (W)   | For cost calculation                 |
| Hot Water Outlet Temperature  | For comfort check (optional)         |
| Hot Water Unmet Demand (kW)   | To quantify service/comfort loss     |

## Implementation Notes

- **Control:** Implement schedule-based control in OCHRE (see `update_external_control` in HPWH code).
- **Comfort Check:** If TOU schedule leads to unmet demand or low temp, can factor "comfort penalty" into switching cost.
- **Outputs:** Compare cost and comfort metrics for both schedules.

# 5. Example Calculation

Suppose:

- Default schedule: HPWH runs as needed.
- TOU schedule: HPWH only runs 10PM–6AM (off-peak).
- Monthly bill (default): $30
- Monthly bill (TOU): $22
- Switching cost: $5 (one-time or amortized)

\[
\Delta C = 30 - 22 = \$8
\]
\[
\text{Net Savings} = 8 - 5 = \$3
\]

**Decision:** Consumer switches to TOU-adaptive schedule.

# 6. Equations

## Electricity Cost Calculation

\[
C_{bill} = \sum_{t} E(t) \cdot r(t)
\]
Where:
- \( E(t) \): Electricity used by HPWH at time \( t \)
- \( r(t) \): Rate (on-peak/off-peak) at time \( t \)

## Comfort Penalty for Unmet Hot Water Demand

If, under the TOU-adapted HPWH schedule, the consumer experiences unmet hot water demand (i.e., water is delivered below setpoint temperature), they incur a penalty reflecting discomfort or service loss. This penalty is computed as:

\[
C_{comfort} = \alpha \cdot \left( \sum_{t} \text{Unmet Demand}(t) \right)
\]

Where:
- \( \alpha \): Monetization factor for comfort loss (e.g., $/kWh unmet or $/event)
- \( \text{Unmet Demand}(t) \): Unmet hot water demand per time step (from OCHRE output)

At each billing cycle, the consumer’s net savings from remaining on the TOU-adapted schedule is:

\[
\text{Net Savings} = \Delta C - C_{switch} - C_{comfort}
\]

If Net Savings ≤ 0, the consumer switches back to the default schedule.

This approach ensures the model realistically captures the trade-off between cost savings and comfort when responding to TOU rates.

## Final Decision

\[
\text{Net Savings} = \Delta C - C_{switch} - C_{comfort}
\]
Switch if Net Savings \( > 0 \).
