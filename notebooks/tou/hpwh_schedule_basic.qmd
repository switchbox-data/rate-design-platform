# Introduction

This document outlines a simple, first-pass heuristic-based decision model for consumer response to time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates in residential building simulations using OCHRE, focusing on Heat Pump Water Heaters (HPWHs). The goal is to integrate an adaptive control schedule for the HPWH based on feedback from utility bills and anticipated cost savings, while accounting for consumer effort in shifting schedules.

# 1. Problem Definition

- **Objective:** Model how a consumer, with fixed (exogenous) hot water usage needs, might reschedule their HPWH operation in response to TOU rates to minimize their electricity bills, considering a "switching cost" for effort and a penalty for compromised comfort (unmet hot water demand).
- **Assumptions:**
    - Hot water usage schedule is fixed (not flexible).
    - HPWH can be controlled (on/off) on a schedule.
    - TOU rate structure (on-peak/off-peak) is known and simple (e.g., higher price during peak hours).
    - Consumer receives feedback on energy cost at each billing cycle (monthly).
    - Switching to a TOU-adapted schedule incurs a one-time "effort cost" (can be fixed or parameterized).
    - Decision process is repeated each billing cycle (feedback loop).

# 3. Model Steps

## Step 1: Calculate Baseline

- **Hot Water Usage:** $U_{HW}$ is fixed by schedule and multiplier.
- **HPWH Default Schedule:** Operates as needed to meet hot water draws.
- **Simulate:** Run OCHRE with default HPWH schedule to get $E_{default}$, $C_{bill,default}$.

## Step 2: Define TOU-Adaptive Schedule

- **HPWH TOU Schedule:** Only operates HPWH during off-peak hours.
  - **Note:** Future implementation will allow the agent to specify a more complicated schedule to optimize between comfort and cost. For now, assume the agent can only choose between default schedule  and TOU-adaptive schedule (only runs during off-peak hours).
- **Simulate:** Run OCHRE with TOU-adaptive HPWH schedule to get $E_{TOU}$, $C_{bill,TOU}$.

## Step 3: Anticipated Savings

- **Calculate:**
$$
\Delta C = C_{bill,default} - C_{bill,TOU}
$$
- **Net Benefit:**
$$
\text{Net Benefit} = \Delta C - C_{switch} - C_{comfort}
$$

**Note:** The only difference in monthly bill is due to the difference in HPWH operation between the default and TOU-adaptive schedules since we are assuming all other factors remain constant in the OCHRE simulation. Thus the agent can use the difference in monthly bill to calculate the anticipated savings.

## Step 4: Decision Rule

- **If** $\text{Net Benefit} > 0$: Consumer switches to TOU-adapted schedule.
- **Else:** Remains on default schedule.

## Step 5: Feedback & Iteration

- At each monthly billing cycle, repeat Steps 1–4 using updated consumption and bills.
- Consumer can reconsider switching if conditions change (e.g., rate structure, switching cost).

# 4. Integration with OCHRE

## Inputs Required

- Hot water usage schedule: $U_{HW}$ (from input schedule file)
- Usage multiplier: $\lambda$ (from building HPXML file)
- TOU rate definition: $r_{on}, r_{off}$ (passed to cost calculation)
- HPWH scheduling control: ability to enforce on/off operation windows (via `update_external_control()` in HPWH code)

## OCHRE Outputs Used

| Output Name                   | Use in Model                         |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Hot Water Delivered (L/min)   | For checking comfort/unmet demand    |
| Water Heating Delivered (W)   | For cost calculation                 |
| Hot Water Outlet Temperature  | For comfort check (optional)         |
| Hot Water Unmet Demand (kW)   | To quantify service/comfort loss     |

## Implementation Notes

- **Control:** Implement schedule-based control in OCHRE (see `update_external_control()` in HPWH code).
- **Comfort Check:** If TOU schedule leads to unmet demand or low temp, can factor "comfort penalty" into switching cost.
- **Outputs:** Compare cost and comfort metrics for both schedules.

# 5. Example Calculation

Suppose:

- Default schedule: HPWH runs as needed.
- TOU schedule: HPWH only runs 10PM–6AM (off-peak).
- Monthly bill (default): $\$30$
- Monthly bill (TOU): $\$22$
- Switching cost: $\$5$ (one-time or amortized)
- Comfort penalty: $\$2$ (due to unmet demand)

$$
\Delta C = 30 - 22 = \$8
$$
$$
\text{Net Benefit} = 8 - 5 - 2 = \$1
$$

**Decision:** Consumer switches to TOU-adaptive schedule.

# 6. Equations

## Electricity Cost Calculation

$$
C_{bill} = \sum_{t} E(t) \cdot r(t)
$$

Where:

- $E(t)$: Total electricity consumption at time $t$

- $r(t)$: Rate (on-peak/off-peak or constant baseline) at time $t$


## Comfort Penalty for Unmet Hot Water Demand

If, under the TOU-adapted HPWH schedule, the consumer experiences unmet hot water demand (i.e., water is delivered below setpoint temperature), they incur a penalty reflecting discomfort or service loss. This penalty is computed as:

$$
C_{comfort} = \alpha \cdot \left( \sum_{t} \text{Unmet Demand}(t) \right)
$$

Where:

- $\alpha$: Monetization factor for comfort loss (e.g., $/kWh unmet or $/event)

- $\text{Unmet Demand}(t)$: nmet hot water demand per time step (from OCHRE output)Add commentMore actions

At each billing cycle, the consumer’s net savings from remaining on the TOU-adapted schedule is:

$$
\text{Net Savings} = \Delta C - C_{switch} - C_{comfort}
$$

If Net Savings ≤ 0, the consumer switches back to the default schedule.

This approach ensures the model realistically captures the trade-off between cost savings and comfort when responding to TOU rates.

## Final Decision

$$
\text{Net Benefit} = \Delta C - C_{switch} - C_{comfort}
$$

Switch if Net Benefit $> 0$.
